# Crosswords Puzzle :game_die:

This repository contains two different programs that interact with each other, allowing to both create and solve a Crosswords Puzzle.

Note that **both programs must use a dictionary** with synonyms as a means to validate words. The dictionary entries must be in the following format for it to work:

* [Word] : [List of synonyms separated by comma]

Check **dictionary.txt** on this repository for an example.

***

The first program (CrosswordsCreator folder), as the name suggests, is the one to **create** the puzzle.

The available options include:

* Creating a new one from scratch;
* Resuming one which was stopped mid-creation and saved to complete later;
* Randomly generate a puzzle.

More detailed intructions are included inside the program. All the needed files are inside the folder.

***

The second program (CrosswordsPlayer folder) loads a puzzle that was created in the first program and allows the user to **solve** it. 

You will be given synonyms as hints for the words in the puzzle and there are multiple options regarding input. 

As in the first program more detailed instructions can be seen when running it. All the needed files are inside the folder.

### Have fun creating and playing Crosswords! :D
